The secret `HF_TOKEN` does not exist in your Colab secrets.
To authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.
You will be able to reuse this secret in all of your notebooks.
Please note that authentication is recommended but still optional to access public models or datasets.

ðŸ“¸ Instagram Caption & Hashtag Generator (Command Line) ðŸ“¸
---------------------------------------------------------
This tool generates captions, emojis, and hashtags for Instagram based on your text input.
It uses publicly available AI models and does NOT require a Hugging Face token.
Ensure you have an active internet connection for initial model download.
---------------------------------------------------------
Enter a keyword or theme for your Instagram post (e.g., 'beautiful sunset', 'morning coffee', 'new pet'): welcome
Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['early_stopping']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
Both `max_new_tokens` (=256) and `max_length`(=80) seem to have been set. `max_new_tokens` will take precedence. Please refer to the documentation for more information. (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation)
